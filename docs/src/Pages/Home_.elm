## Build reliable single page applications

With __elm-spa__, you can create production-ready applications with one command:

```terminal
npx elm-spa new
```

No need to configure webpack, gulp, or any other NPM dev tools. This single __zero-configuration__ CLI comes with a live-reloading dev server, production-ready build command, and even a few scaffolding commands for new and existing applications.

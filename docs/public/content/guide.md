# Guide

Welcome to __elm-spa__, a framework for building web applications with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)!
If you are new to Elm, you should check out [the official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org), which
is a great introduction to the language.

The goal of this guide is to help you solve any problems you might run into when building real world single-page web applications.

## Features

Here are some of the benefits for using __elm-spa__:
1. __Automatic routing__ - routes for your web app are automatically generated based on file names. No need to maintain URL routing logic or wire pages together manually.
1. __User authentication__ - provides an easy way to guarantee certain pages are only visible to signed-in users. Checkout the [user authentication](/examples/user-authentication) section for more details!
1. __Zero configuration__ - Includes a hot-reloading dev server, build tool, and everything you need in one CLI tool! No need for webpack, uglify, or other NPM packages.


## Quickstart

If you already have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed, getting started with __elm-spa__ is easy:

```terminal
mkdir our-cool-app
cd our-cool-app
npx elm-spa new
```

This will create a new project in the `our-cool-app` folder! It will only create __three__ new files:

```bash
our-cool-app/
 - elm.json               # project dependencies
 - src/Pages/Home_.elm    # our homepage
 - public/index.html      # entrypoint to your application
```

Let's run it at `http://localhost:1234`:

```terminal
npx elm-spa server
```

## Installation

So far, we've used [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) so we don't need to install __elm-spa__ directly. If you'd like to run commands from the terminal, without the `npx` prefix, you can install __elm-spa__ like this:

```terminal
npm install -g elm-spa@next
```

You can verify the install succeeded by running `elm-spa help` from your terminal:

```terminal
elm-spa help
